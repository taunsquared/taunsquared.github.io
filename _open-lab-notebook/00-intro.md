{% include toc title="Open Lab Notebook" %}

Welcome to my Open Lab Notebook! This space is where I collect and document my practices, theories, and explorations of Field Neuroscience, or the non-invasive study of nervous systems _in situ_. 


I began this work in collaboration with the [Intelligent Systems Lab](https://www.kampff-lab.org/), where I was a PhD student advised by Dr. Adam R. Kampff. The Intelligent Systems Lab studied how nervous systems "in the wild" (as opposed to in the laboratory) are robust and flexible enough to deal with unexpected situations. Within this context, I developed a framework for non-invasively studying nervous systems in environments and contexts beyond the traditional laboratory. 

You can [**read the full-text of my doctoral thesis here**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iqyfmj1rmcn083z/DanbeeKim_INDP2013_PhDThesis.pdf?st=4jmmexqt&dl=0).

I am now interested in re-examining existing neuroscience data with a new lens -- that **our nervous systems are _storytelling engines_ that our cells build, develop, and evolve to coordinate behavior throughout our body collective**. To learn more, please check out [my current research proposal](/assets/files/Research/DanbeeKim_ResearchProposal_2025.pdf). 

## Current Research Interests and Goals

My top priorities when conducting research are:

- to further develop theoretical frameworks and experimental methods that can support **field neuroscience**, or **the humane study of nervous systems _in situ_**;

- to critically analyze the role of modern neuroscience in perpetuating current systems of oppression, and to redirect the knowledge, wisdom, and insights derived from modern neuroscience towards radical collective liberation;

- to nurture a culture of collaboration, trust, and rigorous imagination; and

- to engage with historical context and in questioning the status quo, both in and out of science.


I am currently interested in developing and collaborating on the following ideas and projects:

 - **An engaging, accessible, and multi-lingual neuroscience primer** _(aka a succinct "big picture" introduction)_ that can **develop shared vocabularies between experts coming together from significantly diverse backgrounds** --  _not just diverse in academic discipline, but also in cultural heritage, language, geographical location, socio-economic situations, learning and communication styles, lived experiences of marginalization, etc._

 - Non-invasive replication studies of classic laboratory neuroscience, psychology, and psychophysics experiments with **larger, more diverse sample sizes and with participants who are neither captive nor coerced**; 

 - **Sustainable long-term, multi-generational, free-choice learning communities**;
