Welcome to my Open Lab Notebook! This space holds all of the ideas and thought processes that went into my doctoral research with the [Intelligent Systems Lab](https://www.kampff-lab.org/), led by Dr. Adam R. Kampff. You can [**read the full-text of my doctoral thesis here**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iqyfmj1rmcn083z/DanbeeKim_INDP2013_PhDThesis.pdf?st=4jmmexqt&dl=0).

The Intelligent Systems Lab studied how nervous systems "in the wild" (as opposed to in the laboratory) are robust and flexible enough to deal with unexpected situations. Within this context, I developed a framework for precisely observing nervous systems in increasingly natural environments and contexts. I worked with the following goals in mind:

- to connect how we study the brain to the subjective experience of living with one;

- to explore frameworks and narratives for nervous system function beyond the stimulus-response-machine metaphor and open-loop causal model of behavioural organization;

- to complement and support laboratory neuroscience by a) checking the ethological validity of behaviour studies and of humane research techniques, and b) increasing the diversity and quantity of neural systems accessible to empirical neuroscientific study;

- to contribute comparative research studying nervous systems in non-rodent and non-human species, in order to better guide generalizations and translations of empirical results beyond the specific individuals or populations that participate in any one experiment;

- to nurture a culture of collaboration, trust, and rigorous imagination in research; and

- to engage with historical context and in questioning the status quo, both in and out of science.
