***“In 2067, the Global Water Crisis wiped out much of humanity, forcing survivors to flee underground or escape 
into orbit. 50 years later, teenager Asoka Morei lives in sheltered privilege at a Green Haven, far from 
the dark and over-crowded Underground Cities. But when Asoka’s Haven is attacked, they must journey into 
the Red Zone to find a mysterious people who may be re-growing the decimated Amazon Rainforest.”***

## Story and Lettering

My research combines studies of cuttlefish, the philosophy of science, Perceptual Control Theory, and the evolution of “the brain” throughout time and in many species. In collaboration with [NeuroGears](https://neurogears.org/), I build interactive art installations that both allow people to participate in field neuroscience experiments, and communicate science in fun and interesting ways. You can learn more at [www.EveryMind.Online](http://www.everymind.online/).  
I spend a lot of time thinking about permaculture, anarchy, circus, and education. I love being in the wilderness, especially in the mountains and by the sea. I got hooked on the neuroscience of storytelling while co-writing and choreographing an original musical called [Hack, Punt, Tool](https://youtu.be/IPpqXyo4jhM). My dream future is to train and play as a musician, capoeirista, and [VIRS (vigilante intergalactic roustabout scholar)](/projects/2018/02/28/VIRS-principles/).

caption="Gideon Gerlt: Graphic Novel title page artist, Chapter 6 pages 9-12 Illustrator and Colourist, and Chapter 7 
title page artist" %}

Early on, Gideon Gerlt's creativity was strongly influenced by the vibrant natural environment of rural Alaska. Exploring 
the wilderness in the shadow of Denali mountain with so little human contact, instilled in him a curiosity about the 
unseen world that existed in such great abundance and yet felt elusive. This sense of mystery has worked alongside a 
pursuit to explore individual and societal concepts of self and other, covering a broad range of topics from 
interpersonal relationships, to concepts of consciousness and artificial intelligence, and an exploration of the 
microbial world.

Gideon's recent works explore the intersection between art, science, and technology. Splicing geometric shapes and 
architectural design with structures found in nature, these works reflect on correlations between micro and macroscopic 
worlds. Inspired by a fascination with biological systems and processes Gideon has created site-specific, interactive, 
multimedia installations that have emulated organic complexity through iterative patterns. These works have suggestively 
represented bacteria, protozoa, neurons, mirror cells, and DNA.

An Aerospace engineer by profession, and an artist at heart, I am a Space geek who loves challenging projects that mix 
Art and Science. Currently pursuing a PhD in Satellite Navigation Technology, I also dedicate a part of my waking hours 
to artistic endeavours and commissions so that it doesn't just remain a hobby, overshadowed by math equations (which are 
also aesthetic in a way).

Julia Zimmerman is an artist and student living in an old house in Vermont with her partner and two cats. She is happy to 
be involved with the First VIRS project because it explores how intellectual or creative work is the product of multiple 
people and organizations, and because it attempts to cross some of the silos we haven’t yet figured out how to avoid 
creating when we specialize. She is generally interested in thought as a resource that takes place outside the individual 
level, alongside language - across people, time, and organizations - and loves being involved with a project exploring 
that lens.

visually compelling. Aside from her client work, Jenn also publishes a series of weekly illustrated science facts under 
her online handle, Alithographica. She holds a degree in biological sciences and illustration from New York University as 
well as a certificate in botanical art and illustration from the New York Botanical Garden, and now resides in Brooklyn
