excerpt: '<p style="text-align: right;">I&#39;m a queer Korean-American <br /> migrant neuroscientist and <br /> polymedia storyteller. I coordinate <br /> the learning collective <br /><strong><em>Dear Neuroscience</em></strong>. <br /><br /> My life is dedicated to <br /> nurturing and participating in <br /> multi-generational, regenerative, <br /> free-choice learning communities. <br /> To learn more about my work, <br /> visit my <a href="https://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook" style="color:#4f00bd">Open Lab Notebook</a> <br /> or read my graphic novel, <br /> <a href="https://www.danbeekim.org/VIRS" style="color:#4f00bd"><em>The First VIRS</em></a>. <br /> <br /> I love to science <br /> in community. I use <br /> performance arts and <br /> crafts, gardening, and <br /> wilderness medicine to <br /> decolonise the practice of <br /> gathering and organising <br /> knowledge. I offer expertise in <br /> the history and philosophy <br /> of neuroscience, and in <br /> the practice of studying and <br /> shaping nervous systems <br /> with non-invasive, non- <br /> coercive, and radically <br /> inclusive tools and <br /> techniques. <br /> <br />If you would like <br /> to chat, collaborate, <br /> skill swap, or engage <br /> in some other flavour of <br /> mind-melding, please email <br /><strong>danbee at danbeekim dot org.</strong><br /> <br /> <br />Thanks for visiting!<br /></p>'
