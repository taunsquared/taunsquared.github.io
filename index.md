excerpt: '<p style="text-align: right;">I&#39;m a queer Korean-American <br /> migrant neuroscientist and storyteller. <br /> I coordinate the learning collective <br /><strong><em>Dear Neuroscience</em></strong>. <br /><br /> My life is dedicated to <br /> nurturing and participating in <br /> multi-generational, regenerative, <br /> free-choice learning communities. <br /> To learn more about my work, <br /> visit my <a href="https://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook" style="color:#4f00bd">Open Lab Notebook</a> <br /> or read my graphic novel, <br /> <a href="https://www.danbeekim.org/VIRS" style="color:#4f00bd"><em>The First VIRS</em></a>. <br /> <br /> I use performance art, <br /> gardening, and wilderness <br /> medicine to decolonise the practice <br /> of gathering and organising knowledge. <br /> I love to science in community, and I offer <br /> expertise in the history and philosophy of <br /> neuroscience, and in the practice of <br /> studying and shaping nervous systems with <br /> non-invasive, non-coercive, and radically <br /> inclusive tools and techniques. <br /> <br />If you would like to chat, skill swap, <br /> collaborate, or engage in another <br /> flavour of mind-melding, please email <br /><strong>danbee at danbeekim dot org.</strong><br /> <br /> <br />Thanks for visiting!<br /></p>'
