Hi! ^.^

My name is Danbee (단비), which in Korean means (literally) "sweet rain" and (idiomatically) "rain that comes at just the right moment". <br/>

I'm a queer Korean-American field neuroscientist, storyteller, dancer, and dreamer who spends a lot of time thinking about anatomy, movement, empowerment, community building, re-indigenisation, diasporas, and the ocean. I love being in the wilderness, especially in the mountains and by the sea. <br/>

I love helping experts across specialities collaborate and share insights. I especially enjoy crafting multi-sensory interactive free-choice learning experiences. <br/>

I got hooked on the neuroscience of storytelling while co-writing and choreographing an original musical called <a href="https://hackpunttool.com/">Hack, Punt, Tool</a> (you can watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/IPpqXyo4jhM">2017 production on YouTube</a>). Since then I've written and performed a set of [original "science songs"](/brainplay/2017-09-14-Pilot-Data-Aronauts-EP/), created an [interactive aquarium exhibit](http://www.everymind.online/SurprisingMinds/) that collected neuroscience data from over 24,000 visitors, and self-published a YA sci-fi graphic novel called [_The First VIRS_](/VIRS). <br/>

My dream futures are full of intergenerational communities of creative and cooperative people passionate about lifelong learning and mutual benefit. I believe that empowering everyone to study nervous systems in their daily lives and making neuroscience research as accessible as possible is an important part of achieving this future. <br/>

I am currently based in the UK, but I travel often in order to also be in community with loved ones in the US and Portugal. <br/>

I organize and teach for the [Appalachian Institute for Creative Learning](https://appalachianinstitute.org/), a summer enrichment camp for rising 3rd through 12th graders in the US, and [Neuronautas](https://gulbenkian.pt/academias/videos/fundacao-champalimaud/), a summer intensive field neuroscience program for teenagers in Portugal. I'm an alumni mentor for the MIT freshman seminar course [Terrascope](https://terrascope.mit.edu/). <br/>

If you would like to get in touch, please email me at danbee[at]alum[dot]mit[dot]edu. <br/>
